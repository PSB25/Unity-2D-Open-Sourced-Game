Hello, and welcome to my game called, "Hyperball".

The goal of the game is simple. How long can you have the Ball bounce without it leaving the square (stopwatch is recommended).

Should the player fail to keep the ball in the square, they are forced to retry from the start.

To get it up and running is simple. All you have to do is open it thrugh Unity and select Build and Run.

I hope everyone enjoys this simple game, but I should mention that the ball moves pretty fast!!
